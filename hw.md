## Homework:

Build a system that will ask the user for 5
grade scores (out of 100) for a certain class.
Then output the MEAN and MEDIAN of the data set,
and also the MODE of each grade.

1. Ask the user for 5 letter grades using loops and store 
the grades into a container (`list`, `set`, `dict`, etc... you choose)

2. Use the container with the `DataFrame` class to
print out the MEAN and MEDIAN, as well as the MODE
of each grade
